# BattleWords

BattleWords is a mobile game currently targeted for Android. It is a mix of the classic boardgame Battleship and Wordle. In single player mode, Players attempt to find 3, 4, and 5-letter words on a 6x6 grid by either tapping on a grid tile or typing a word. Letters on the keyboard inform the user if the letter is not found at all in any word, if some of the letters have been found, or if all letters have been found. The game continues if either the player runs out of turns or finds all words on the board.

Multiplayer mode will have players face one another, similar to Battleship, and take turns making guesses to hopefully find all words on the board before the opposing player does.
